Someone -- hopefully you -- requested a password reset for your user account at {{ site_name }}.

If you sent this request, use the following link to reset your password:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you didn't send this request, not to worry -- your account is safe and your password has not been changed.

Thank you for using {{ site_name }}!
